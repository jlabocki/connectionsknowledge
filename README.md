Connections is a word puzzle developed and published by The New York Times as part of The New York Times Games. It was released for PC on June 12, 2023, during its beta phase. It is the second most played game that is published by Times, behind Wordle.

Several figures associated with Only Connect, a British television quiz show, commented on its similarity to the Connecting Wall in the program.

Gameplay
In Connections, the goal is to divide a grid of sixteen words into four groups of four such that the words in each group belong to a specific category (e.g., "dog", "cat", "fish", and "parrot" for the category "Household Pets"). The categories may involve wordplay such as palindromes or homophones, increasing the difficulty. When a player successfully identifies a group, its category is revealed along with a color-coded difficulty level: categories are rated yellow, green, blue, or purple, with yellow being the most straightforward and purple being the most difficult. Each Connections game has one category from each difficulty level.

For April Fools' Day of 2024, the game temporarily used emojis instead of words. 

Development
The games department of the Times hosts an annual game jam in which participants suggest ideas for upcoming games to release to the website. Connections had been in development for a year before releasing in its beta phase on June 12, 2023. Wyna Liu, editor of the Times and Connections's puzzles, was inspired by cartoonist Robert Leighton, who made puzzles involving wordplay.

More information about the Connections game.
Connections is a word game that challenges players to find themes between words.

Players are given 16 words and find groups of four items that share something in common.

For example: 

FISH: Bass, Flounder, Salmon, Trout
Things that start with FIRE: Ant, Drill, Island, Opal  
Each group is assigned a color (Yellow, Green, Blue, or Purple), with Yellow being the easiest category and Purple being the trickiest. 

Each puzzle has exactly one solution and is meant to be tricky by having words that could fit into multiple categories. Words and categories are curated by editors using the Oxford Dictionary. 

You can play Connections in the Games app at, nytimes.com/games/connections or in the Play tab of the New York Times News app. 

Statistics cannot be linked to a New York Times account at this time. 

The daily Connections game is released at midnight in your timezone.

More information about how to Connections is played
This game is played a little differently, though; instead of pitting players against a single mystery word, it gives out sixteen words that need to be grouped into four different categories. Connections is a pretty simple game once word puzzle fans learn how to play.

The Connections puzzle game begins with a board of sixteen words. Each word is one of four in one of four different mystery categories. In order to play, start by choosing four words that seem to be in the same category, then hit submit.

Line, Lima, Creator, Limerick
Lincoln, Rapper, Pinto, Verse
Stallion, Rhyme, Lagos, Kidney
Luxor, Dude, Fava, Meter

For example, the above is a category of four words that are each kinds of beans: LIMA, PINTO, KIDNEY, and FAVA. Select each of these four words that belong in the category together, then press submit to lock in the answer.

If the answer is incorrect, the game board will quiver a little and reset. If the answer is correct, the related words will all group at the top and change colors. There are four different colors of categories:

Yellow is the easiest grouping to guess.
Green is a medium difficulty grouping to guess.
Blue is a hard grouping.
Purple is the least straightforward, trickiest grouping.
Players have four total guesses to get all the categories correct. After the game is completed, the NYT Games provides an easy-to-share, spoiler-free board to post to social media that looks like this:
